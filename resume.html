                            <b>C++</b> -- Intermediate. I'm currently most comfortable with C++. I have been using it very frequently
                            for the past year since it is the language of choice used in most intensive CS classes at Texas A&M. 
                            Besides that, I've also used it outside of school assignments, when studying for (and during) technical/coding interviews.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Python</b> -- Intermediate. I first learned Python around 2 years ago, starting with online courses and independent
                            learning, then completing projects in class, then more independent learning. Although I still have much more to learn,
                            I'm very comfortable with the language if I ever have to pick it up again for a project.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>HTML/CSS</b> -- Beginner. I learned the basics of HTML and CSS around 2 years ago, but have not been using
                            it much since. Although, while building this website I became a lot more comfortable with both and learned a lot.

                            <b>Web Development</b> -- With the goal of eventually learning full-stack web development in mind, right now I'm especially
                            interested in gaining front-end experience: UI/UX Design, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript frameworks.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Intelligent Systems & AI</b> -- From speech recognition to robots to augmented reality like Microsoft HoloLens, I think 
                            computers that interact with and understand (in some ways) the world around them are fascinating, and I would love
                            to learn how they are created and improved because the applications are endless.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Data Science</b> -- I'm interested in how data scientists analyze, visually represent, and draw conclusions from the 
                            massive amount of data that is collected everyday. I think there is a lot to learn about people and their behavior
                            from those trends, and I would definitely like to learn how to process data and turn it into something meaningful.
