                </h3>
                <p>My freshman year (2019-2020), I was a member of SWElites, a freshmen leadership program within <a href="https://www.swetamu.com/">SWE
                    (Society of Women Engineers)</a> at 
                    Texas A&M University. I worked together with my team and counselors in the STEMfest Committee under the Contact team to organize 
                    an annual event called STEMfest at Texas A&M. STEMfest is an event where the Society of Women Engineers teams up with Girl Scouts 
                    to host a fun event full of hands on activities that expose young girls to STEM. 
                    <br><br>
                    Our committee met weekly for an hour to plan and organize this event. My sub-team, specifically, was responsible for contacting
                    student organizations and departments to host booths. We looked up contact information, tracked our contacts on a spreadsheet, and 
                    sent out numerous emails over a six-month period. By the end, we contacted over 200 TAMU organizations and departments and hosted
                    a very successful and fun event!   
                    <br><br>

                    TL;DR: Contacted over 200 orgs on campus to organize and host STEMfest, an annual event at Texas A&M for Girl Scouts!

                    In Spring 2020 I also served on the <a href="https://www.swetamu.com/swe-inspire">SWE Outreach</a> committee, which is another program within the Society of Women Engineers
                    at Texas A&M University. SWE Outreach aims to teach K-12 students about engineering and engage their interest through fun,
                    hands-on lessons and activities. Under SWE Outreach, I was specifically a part of the SWE Inspire committee, which introduces
                    engineering, math, and science concepts to young children in a way that is exciting, and shows them how much you can accomplish
                    in the STEM field. 
                    <br><br>
                    I traveled with my partner to local elementary schools around the College Station and Bryan area. We held one-hour long lessons
                    where we taught them about the various Engineering disciplines through hands-on activities such as learning robotics or 
                    building a bridge with classroom materials. Unfortunately, the program was cut short due to the beginning of the spread of
                    COVID, but I hope to participate in the group again in the future. I really enjoy teaching, especially young children, so it was 
                    a really fun and meaningful opportunity.
